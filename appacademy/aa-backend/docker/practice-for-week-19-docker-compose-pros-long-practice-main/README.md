# Become Compose Pros

In the words of Docker, "Compose is a tool for defining and running
multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to
configure your applicationâ€™s services. With a single command, you can create and
start all the services from your configuration." As you learned in the Compose
readings, you can define a complex stack in one file and have it running with a
single command! This means you would no longer need separate terminal tabs for
running your server and your front end, and no more defining containers by hand!
The people at Docker choose to call this gift **Docker Compose**.

Using Compose is basically a three-step process.

1. Define your app's environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced
   anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so they can
   be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, use the `docker-compose up` command so Compose will start and run
   your entire app.

## Phase 1: Flask and Redis

Time to take on your destiny and write some fantastic Docker Compose files! To
begin, you'll take a very simple Flask and Redis application and create a
compose file to run it locally. Start off by taking a look at the
[skeleton][skeleton].

### Compose file

The Flask app will contain the following components:

1. The Flask server that accepts user requests and stores the data in Redis.
2. Redis which acts as the database.

You are provided with the `Dockerfile` that will set up the Flask server for
you. What you don't want is one container running both the Flask server and
Redis database. Ideally, you want two containers - one for the Flask server, and
one for the database.

Since you have two main parts in the current architecture for your application
(server and database), you'll want to run two _services_. You will have a
service named `web` for the Flask server, and a service named `redis` for the
`redis` database. For the future, a simple rule of thumb is to create **one
service for each image** in your application.

**Quick Reminder:** indentation is how the YAML file formats group information,
so indentation is important.

Start by filling out the version in the blank `docker-compose.yml` file. 
For the rest of this phase, this is where you'll be working. 

As you previously learned, `docker-compose` has many versions. For this project, 
you will use version '3'. Take a look at the [Compose documentation][docs] if 
you need additional reference about syntax. Go ahead and add the version now.

### Flask (web)

For your `Flask` app, you will need to build the image in the `Dockerfile` in
order for it to run properly. If you need a reminder on how that is done, check
out the [Docker documentation][build-docs] on the subject. Indicate to Docker
that you want to `build` and make sure to name your image using the `image`
command in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

Similar to how you usually run containers, you can set exposed ports and
environment variables for this image. Set the `FLASK_ENV=development` for your
environment. For this service, you'll also want to expose ports on localhost and
within the container at port `5000`.

### Redis (redis)

You won't need to customize the `redis` image - you are just going to use the
image straight from Docker Hub. Set the `image` command to use the
`redis:4.0.11-alpine` version.

### Try it!

Now try running it with the `docker-compose up` command! It'll take a while to
build because it has to pull the necessary images and build from the
`Dockerfile`.

The first thing it will do is create a new network for you, before building your
image.

```ssh
Creating network "phase1_default" with the default driver
Building web
Step 1/7 : FROM python:3.7.0-alpine3.8
 ---> cf41883b24b8
```

Then it will run through the steps in the Dockerfile. After it has built your 
image, you'll see a message that both of your containers
have been started and attached to the network. 

```ssh
Creating phase1_web_1   ... done
Creating phase1_redis_1 ... done
Attaching to phase1_web_1, phase1_redis_1
```

Then, you'll get some colored logs for each container!

You can use `CTRL+C` to exit the logs. You'll see this message as you exit:

```ssh
Stopping phase1_redis_1 ... done
Stopping phase1_web_1   ... done
```

A quick `docker container ls` or `docker ps` will confirm that your containers
are no longer running. If you use the `docker container ls -a` or `docker ps -a`
command, you'll see your containers and that they have just stopped. If you use
the `docker network ls` command, you'll see the network that had been
automatically created for you is still there. Let's try that again. Use
`docker-compose down` so that **Docker Compose** will remove the containers 
and network.

### Try it again!

Now try running `docker compose up -d` to run compose in **detached mode**. 
Then use `docker-compose ps` to view your running services.

```ssh
     Name                   Command               State           Ports         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
phase1_redis_1   docker-entrypoint.sh redis ...   Up      6379/tcp              
phase1_web_1     /bin/sh -c flask run --hos ...   Up      0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp
```

**Reminder:** If you did have to change something in your `Dockerfile` and
rebuild your image, you need to use the `docker-compose up --build` or `docker
compose build` command to rebuild the image. Otherwise, Compose won't know about
the changes!

Let's try out the Flask app! Head to `http://localhost:5000` and you should see
an empty array.

![phase-1a-solution-screenshot][solution-image-1a]

You could use Postman to test your app or use the below command to send a 'POST'
request:

```ssh
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--data '{"name":"Jake"}' \
localhost:5000
```

You should get a response with the name. Now head to
`http://localhost:5000`. If you see `Jake`, then you've done it!

![phase-1b-solution-screenshot][solution-image-1b]

### Investigation

Take a moment to observe what is going on in the `app.py` file, where Redis is
being set up. As a reminder, containers on the same Docker Compose network can
refer to each other by service name. If you look below, you'll see where access
from the `web` container is set up to the `redis` container.

```python
# host="redis" is referring to the name of your service!!
redis = Redis(host="redis", db=0, socket_timeout=5, charset="utf-8", decode_responses=True)
```

As you can see, the value of the **host** argument is set to `redis`. This is
because the name of the `Redis` service is `redis` in your Compose file. This
way, you can easily connect containers to each other with Docker Compose. You
can also specify network setups that are complex beyond the default network.

Make sure to use the `docker-compose down` command to clean up your containers
and networks. Also, don't forget to use Git from now on to commit your Compose
files.

## Phase 2: The Voting App

You will be creating the `docker-compose.yml` file for a voting application for
the world's toughest question: "cats or dogs?". Users can cast their votes,
which will be saved, and admin users can see the votes cast. This is an
application based on micro-services architecture, consisting of 5 individually
simple services.

1. **Voting-App:** The frontend of the application written in Python, used by
   users to cast their votes.
2. **Redis:** The in-memory database, used as intermediate storage.
3. **Worker:** A .Net service, used to fetch votes from Redis and store in a
   Postgres database.
4. **DB:** A PostgreSQL database, used as the database.
5. **Result-App:** Frontend of the application written in Node.js which displays
   the voting results.

![voting-app](https://assets.aaonline.io/Docker/voting.png)

All of the images you need are on Docker Hub. You will be creating the services,
exposing ports, setting up volumes, and connecting containers through your own
networks. Let's get started!

### Services

Start off by defining your Compose version as '3'. You'll be creating five
separate services and pulling their images from Docker Hub. **The names of these
services do matter**. For the images, make sure you use the names for each
service as described below. Additionally, you'll be creating two 
[custom networks][compose-custom] "frontend" and "backend".

Breakdown of the five services

1. **vote**: frontend of the application written in Python.
2. **redis**: in-memory key/value storage for incoming votes
3. **worker**: used to fetch votes from Redis and store in a Postgres database.
4. **db**: the database,  where one [named volume][named-v] will be needed,
   pointing to `/var/lib/postgresql/data` in order to persist data.
5. **result**: node web app that shows results to administrators

| Service | Image                                          | Local Port | Container Port | Network           |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| vote    | `dockersamples/examplevotingapp_vote:before`   | 5000       | 80             | Frontend          |
| redis   | `redis:3.2`                                    |            |                | Frontend          |
| worker  | `dockersamples/examplevotingapp_worker`        |            |                | Frontend, Backend |
| db      |  `postgres:9.4`                                |            |                | Backend           |
| result  | `dockersamples/examplevotingapp_result:before` | 5001       | 80             | Backend           |

For your **db** service, you'll need to set an `environment` variable to
initialize your Postgres database. Take a look at the 
[official Postgres image documentation] 
on Docker Hub to learn more about _How to extend this image_ by
setting environment variables in configuration.

To easily configure your first Postgres image, you'll set a
`POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD` environment variable to `trust`. According to the
documentation, "it is not recommended to use `trust` since it allows anyone to
connect without a password." You'll get more real-application practice later in
today's project and in the future. In the next phase, you'll configure a
Postgres image by setting a `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` variable. In a future project,
you'll configure a Postgres image with `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and
`POSTGRES_DB` environment variables, similarly to how you would set the
`DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_DATABASE` environment variables for an
application.

### Try it!

Now try it all together! Run `docker-compose up`.

> HINT: If you get yourself in a bind and need to clear out all docker objects, 
> then run `docker-compose down` followed by `docker system prune -a`. 
> It is thorough, so use with caution!

Notice that when you specify custom networks, Docker Compose doesn't 
automatically make a network for you. Compose just makes the networks you 
specified:

```
Creating network "phase_frontend" with the default driver
Creating network "phase_backend" with the default driver
```

If you use the `docker compose down` command, then the `docker compose up -d`
command, you can view running containers with the `docker container ps` command.
You can also view the networks that Compose created by using the `docker network
ls` command. 

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` and you should be able to vote
for either "dogs" or "cats". Once you've cast your vote, refresh and make sure
your vote persisted. Now checkout `http://localhost:5001` to see the `result`
service at work. You can view the number of votes and who voted for what.

**Hint:** You can simulate being a second person using an **Incognito** or 
**Private** window in your browser. If you have multiple browsers you can 
pretend to be many people.

![phase-2-solution-screenshot][solution-image-2]

Awesome job! After you've debated about "cats vs. dogs", move onto the next
phase after running `docker-compose down`.

## Phase 3: Build Your Own Dockerfile and Compose File

One of the best things about Docker is that you can easily work with unfamiliar
technologies without spending hours to set up a development environment. For
this next phase, you'll be using a service called Drupal. [Drupal][drupal] is a
free and open-source content-management framework written in PHP. Even though
you've probably never worked with Drupal, you'll
quickly have it up and running!

You'll write a custom `Dockerfile` and start your app with Docker Compose. When
configured properly, you'll build a custom image and use the `docker compose up`
command. Remember to store the `db` and `config` data in volumes so that your
application will remember changes across Compose restarts.

To make sure you remember, go ahead and create a `.dockerignore` file to 
prevent your _Dockerfile_ and the _.git_ folder from loading into the image.

### Dockerfile

For this first part, you will be:

1. Creating a custom `Dockerfile` for the `drupal` image.
2. Downloading and using `Git` to install a custom Drupal [Bootstrap][bootstrap]
   HTML theme.

Start by creating a `Dockerfile` that will be built from `drupal:8.6`. 


You'll need to install **Git** for the next part, but the `drupal:8.6` image 
doesn't currently have it - meaning you'll need to download it! Use `RUN` to 
invoke the `apt` package manager command to install Git: 
`apt-get update && apt-get install -y git`. 

Whenever you download anything inside a Docker container, the installation 
almost always leaves extra files you don't want in your image. Clean up after 
your installation by adding the command `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`. 
Make sure to use `\` and `&&` properly!

The next step is to change your working directory (`WORKDIR`) within the
container to access where Drupal keeps HTML templates (`/var/www/html/themes`).
Then use Git to clone in your chosen theme using the command:

```ssh
git clone --branch 8.x-3.x --single-branch --depth 1 https://git.drupal.org/project/bootstrap.git
```

**Note:** The reason you are telling Git `--single-branch --depth 1` is because
you only want the most recent version of this one branch. This saves you a _ton_
of time over downloading all the branches, so it's a handy way to avoid extra
bloat in your image.

Now you just need to solve one last problem. Something you might encounter while
working with Docker is having to [change file permissions][file-permissions].
The files you just used Git to download have been put in the directory under the
ownership of `root`. However, the `drupal` image is expecting all the files it
will be running to be under the ownership of the `www-data` user. This means you
will need to change the permissions of these files.

You will use the [`chown`][chown] command to change the file ownership of these
permissions. Chain the following command to the last `RUN` statement in your
Dockerfile: `chown -R www-data:www-data bootstrap`. When you use `chown -R`, you
are saying you want to change the owner for all files recursively (including 
directories). This allows `drupal` to access all the files in the `bootstrap` 
directory properly.

### Compose file

Now you will build your custom `drupal` image in a `docker-compose.yml`. Again
use version 3. You'll be using one custom Drupal service (drupal) and one 
PostgreSQL service (postgres).

Build the custom Drupal image using the `Dockerfile` you previously created.
Name it `<yourusername>/custom-drupal`. Expose your local port `8080` and point
at port `80` in the container. Let this service know it **depends on** the other
one.

For the PostgreSQL service, you'll be setting up an environment variable and a
volume. Use the image for `postgres:9.6` and set your environment variable for
the database password using `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. Add a named volume for
`drupal-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`, so the database will persist across
Compose restarts.

### Putting it together

Use the `docker-compose up -d` command to start your application. Navigate to
`http://localhost:8080` and you'll see this nice UI to configure `drupal`.

![phase-3a-solution-screenshot][solution-image-3a]

At this point all you want to know is if the `HTML` Bootstrap theme you
downloaded in your custom `Dockerfile` is available. Click the obvious options,
and use the "Minimal" profile, until you get to the `database` set-up page.

On the database set-up page, select `PostgreSQL` because that is the database
you are using. The following list corresponds directly to what you set in your
`docker-compose.yml` file.

1. `database name` since you didn't specify the default name is 'postgres'.
2. `Database username` defaults to `postgres`.
3. `Database password` will be what you set the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment
   variable to.
4. Click `Advanced Options`. The **host** name will be the **name of your
   postgres service**.

![phase-3b-solution-screenshot][solution-image-3b]

Next, Drupal will build your site! On the next page, you'll encounter a
'configure site' page which you can fill in with whatever you please, since you
won't be checking this site in the future. As a reminder, the email boxes will
need an `@` sign. After that, you should have access to the main Drupal service!

![phase-3c-solution-screenshot][solution-image-3c]

When the website comes up, click on `Administration`.

![phase-3d-solution-screenshot][solution-image-3d]

Then, click on the `Appearance` link within the **Administration** section.

![phase-3e-solution-screenshot][solution-image-3e]

If you see a theme called `Bootstrap` then you have been successful! `Bootstrap`
was the theme you were attempting to import - the one you added with your custom
Dockerfile.

![phase-3f-solution-screenshot][solution-image-3f]

Click `Install and set as default` and then click your site name (in the top
bar). Now the website interface should be different. You've successfully
installed and activated a new theme in your own custom image without installing
anything on your host other than Docker!

![phase-3g-solution-screenshot][solution-image-3g]

If you exit (`ctrl-c`) back in your terminal and then use the `docker-compose
down` command, it will delete your containers, but not the volumes. Since your
volumes are not deleted by running the `docker-compose down` command, your
application will be the same on next `docker-compose up`. To clean up volumes,
add `-v` to the `down` command.

Now you have all the tools you need to run and host your own projects locally
with Docker!
