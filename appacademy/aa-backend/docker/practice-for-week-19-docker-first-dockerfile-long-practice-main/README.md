# First Dockerfile

As you start developing with Docker you'll find that most of the time basic
docker images won't satisfy your custom or complex image needs. That's where a
Dockerfile becomes essential. A Dockerfile is a text file that defines a Docker
image. Youâ€™ll use a Dockerfile to create your own custom Docker image, in other
words- to define your custom environment to be used in a Docker container. Being
able to create and customize a Dockerfile is an essential part of working with
Docker. At this end of today's project, you'll have an understanding of how to
use the following Docker commands:

* `FROM` to specify an image and image version;
* `docker build .` to build a new image based on a Dockerfile;
* `WORKDIR` to change your current directory or create a new directory if the
  specified location doesn't exist; and,
* `CMD` to specify what happens every time a container is run with a specific
  image.

## Creating a Dockerfile

You'll be exploring more complex Dockerfiles later, but let's start off with
something fun. You'll be creating a simple image for a Node server and running
it with a Docker container. Create a new file simply named `Dockerfile`. Yep
that's it, no extension.

In this file, as in all Dockerfiles, the first thing you will write is the
`FROM` command. The argument that you'll hand to this command is an image and
the version of that image. You'll be using node (you can find your node version
by using `node --version`). It is **always** a good idea to make sure that
whatever image version you plan to use matches the version you are using in
development. Again, you'll be using Node so check out the [node][dh-node] image
on Docker Hub and find the version that corresponds to your own. Once you've
found it use the `alpine` tagged version of the image and hand it to your
Dockerfile.

At this point, your Dockerfile should look something like this:

```docker
FROM node:11.0.0-alpine
```

Now make sure you are in the same directory as the Dockerfile and you can run
the command `docker build .`. This will build a new image based on the
Dockerfile you just wrote. Check it out using `docker image ls`.

```ssh
REPOSITORY                            TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
node                                  11.0.0-alpine       5d526f8ba00b        4 months ago        71.1MB
```

Now you'll want to tag that image properly so people know you made it! Use
`docker build . -t <yourusername>/node` to rebuild your image. It'll
automatically be tagged with the default `latest` tag because you didn't specify
a tag when building. Now check it out with `docker image ls`:

```ssh
REPOSITORY                            TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
node                                  11.0.0-alpine       5d526f8ba00b        4 months ago        71.1MB
rkoron/node                           latest              5d526f8ba00b        4 months ago        71.1MB
```

Note the image IDs are the same - that's because you have just re-tagged an
existing image.

Now you'll create a simple Node server - make a new file named `server.js` and
insert the following:

```js
var http = require("http");

http
  .createServer(function(req, res) {
    res.write("Hello World! It's good to be here.");
    res.end();
  })
  .listen(8000);
```

Awesome! But how do you get this file into Docker? If you start up your
container with the image it has now, it'll just exit out because you haven't
given it the proper command to run when the container starts. Let's fix that by
adding a couple of commands to the Dockerfile you created earlier. The goal is
to make sure your container can access the `server.js` file so that it can run
it.

The first command you'll use is `WORKDIR` - which will either change your
current location or create a new directory if the specified location doesn't
exist and change your location to that new directory. You'll want to make a new
directory for the `server.js` file you'll be transferring over so you'll use the
`WORKDIR` command and pass it `/app` to let Docker know you want a new directory
to be made for you.

Now that the `/app` directory exists, all you need to do is copy your
`server.js` file so that it will be in your built image. Do that by utilizing
the `COPY` command. The first argument will be the file you want to copy
(`server.js`). The second argument will be where you want to put that file
(`/app`). Nice! Now rebuild your image and give it a tag for fun: `docker build
. -t <userusername>/node-server`.

Let's check out the change you made in your image by running a container based
on that image. You can directly see the file you just added by utilizing the
Node image built in shell (located in the image file system under `/bin/sh`).

Run an interactive container based off your image by running `docker container
run -it <yourusername>/node-server /bin/sh`. This will open an interactive shell
where you can `ls` to see file directories or whatever else you need. You should
see an `/app` folder, and when you look inside you'll see `server.js`.

Nice! Time to put it all together! Run your simple node script locally, without
Docker, by using `node server.js` and browsing to `http://localhost:8000`. Once
you've stopped that server, use your shiny new image to have the exact same
behavior.

You'll need to expose a port on your localhost when running the new container.
You'll also need to tell your container what command you want it to run (`node
server.js`). Remember that `server.js` is listening on port 8000 - so that's the
port in the container where traffic should flow. Make sure to start your
container in a detached state (using `-d`)! You just want your server running in
the background, not taking over your terminal. Go to your localhost on the port
you specified and you'll see your server running! Good job!

One last thing, what if you didn't want to specify the `node server.js` command
every time you ran a container based on this image? That sounds pretty annoying.
Let's utilize the `CMD` command- which will specify what happens every time a
container is run using this image. The `CMD` command should always be at the end
of the Dockerfile and it accepts an array with string arguments. For these
purposes, you want to pass the `CMD` the argument of `["node", "server.js"]`.
Now rebuild your Dockerfile one more time and try booting up your container
without passing an argument like this:

```ssh
docker container run --name node -d -p 80:8000 rkoron/node:latest
```

Swing over to `http://localhost:80` and you should see your server running!
Great job making your first Dockerfile!! Make sure to clean up by removing your
running containers. To be extra fastidious you can also remove the image you
built using `docker image rm <imageidORname>`.
