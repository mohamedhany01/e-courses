# Refactoring CSS Practice

In this practice, you will be refactoring CSS written by another developer to
meet new requirements.  This is a common task on the job.  Designs change,
themes get refreshed, or a design ends up just not looking quite right.

Your main focus is to practice changing someone else's code while you familiarize
yourself with the vast typography, sizing, text styling and use of background
images that CSS has to offer.

Once you have downloaded the starter, open the __index.html__ file in your
browser. Then, navigate to the __main.css__ file and start refactoring the code
to meet the new requirements.

Don't forget to save and refresh your page to see the changes!
