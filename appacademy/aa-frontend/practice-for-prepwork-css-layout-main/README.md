# CSS Layout Project

In this project, we will be using the HTML Forms project as the start point to
apply Cascading Style Sheets. You will be adding styles to the HTML elements
to try to replicate the wireframe below.

## Phase 1: Link CSS to HTML Forms

Open your HTML Forms project and link your stylesheet named `layout.css` to it.
Once it is linked you can start styling the HTML Forms project and have it shown
on your browser.

## Phase 2: Follow the Wireframe

CSS allows the developer to customize the page to how they see fit. We have
provided a rough wireframe to be guidelines for your layout. Once the layout
is made feel free to add more padding, colors, and stylings to your page to make
the form how you want it to look.
