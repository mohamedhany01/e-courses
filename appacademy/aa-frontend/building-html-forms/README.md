# Building HTML Forms

This project allows you to use all the HTML forms knowledge you've learned so far. Using what you know about input elements create a detailed form gathering information about a user.

In this project, you are creating a basic survey form for the students and faculty of a/A to find out what their favorite programming language is with any additional comments they would like to submit.

At a minimum, your form must have the elements and features listed below.

- Form element with a post method
- Fieldset element
- Legend element titled "Add user"
- Single-lined text input field for the first name
- Single-lined text input field for the last name
- Single-lined text input field for the email address
- Select element labeled "Status" with three options:
    - Student
    - Instructor
    - Guest
- A `<p>` tag with the sentence "Choose your favorite programming language:"
- A radio button with the label "HTML"
- A radio button with the label "CSS"
- A radio button with the label "JavaScript"
- A text area labeled "Comments"
- Input element for the date labeled current date
- A checkbox input element labeled "Sign up for newsletter"
- A checkbox input element label "Agree to terms and conditions"
- A submit button labeled "Submit"

## Phase 0: Setup

Create a new repository in GitHub. This is a good opportunity to practice using Github and getting familiar with managing and pushing your projects up to your own repo.

You do want a README, so check that box. You don't need a .gitignore file yet, or a license. Not choosing a license at all is actually the strongest option - it's assumed you reserve all rights!

Clone your new repo and open it locally. Create a new file called `index.html` and open it.

## Phase 1: Creating the Form

Start by creating the HTML doc with the correct HTML tags and include the following in the body:

- Form element with a post method
- Fieldset element
- Legend element labeled "Add user"

## Phase 2: Basic Information

After you've completed your set up start gathering basic information of the user:

- Single-lined text input field for the first name
- Single-lined text input field for the last name
- Single-lined text input field for the email address

## Phase 3: Drop Down Menu

Create a drop-down menu with the following:

- Select element labeled "Status" with three options:
    - Student
    - Teacher
    - Guest

## Phase 4: Radio Buttons

Create a set of radio buttons that ask the user what their favorite programming language is:

- A `<p>` tag with the sentence "Choose your favorite programming language:"
- A radio button with the label "HTML"
- A radio button with the label "CSS"
- A radio button with the label "JavaScript"

## Phase 5: Additional Information

Create elements that allow the user to input additional information and the current date.

- A text area labeled "Comments"
- Input element for the date labeled current date

## Phase 6: Submission

Create two check boxes that allow the user to sign up for the newsletter and to agree to the terms and conditions. Finally, make a submit button that allows the user to submit their information.

- A checkbox input element labeled "Sign up for newsletter"
- A checkbox input element label "Agree to terms and conditions"
- A submit button labeled "Submit"
