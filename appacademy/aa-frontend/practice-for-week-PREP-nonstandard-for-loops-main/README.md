# Non-Standard For-Loops Practice

In this practice, you will be provided some skeleton code of functions that
execute for-loops in a specified manner.

Your job is to read the description of each function and write the code that
returns an array with the proper contents. If not specified, contents of your
result array should be in the order they appear in the original input.

Download the starter [here][starter].

Tests have been written for you already to test if your answers behave as
intended. To run the tests, simply run:

```shell
npm install
```

Followed by:

```shell
npm run test
```

If your tests aren't running, make sure Mocha is installed globally.
