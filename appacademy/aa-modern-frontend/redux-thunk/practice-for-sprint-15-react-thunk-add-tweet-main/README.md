# Add A Post to Twitter Thunk App

In the videos, you learned how to create a _thunk_ as well as how to create a
`GET` route that goes from the Express backend through the `thunk`
middleware all the way to the component. Now it's your turn to create a `POST`
route for the tweets.

## Setup

Clone the starter repo accessible from the `Download Project` button at the
bottom of this page.

## Backend

Take a moment to look through all of the backend code. Then do the following:

1. `cd` into the __backend__ directory
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Copy the **.env.example** file to a new file in the same location called
   **.env**
   * The server should be listening for requests on port `5000`
   * The SQLite3 database file should be **db/dev.db**
4. Run
   * `npm run db:setup` - create the database and tables and insert seed data
   * `npm start` - start the backend server
5. Create a POST route to add a tweet with no validation. Refer to the GET route
   that is in your __routes/api/tweets.js__ file and make the changes based on a
   POST route

## Frontend

1. `cd` into the __frontend__ directory
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see the frontend

In the __frontend__ folder, you are going to add all the pieces to `POST` a
fetch call to the backend, which will subsequently add a tweet to the database.
If successful, the browser should automatically update the page based on the
`useSelector` that was already created in the videos.

Without giving you the explicit steps this time, here is a barebones checklist
of what you need to do:

### Store

- Add a _thunk action creator_ to add a post to the database using the `POST`
  route you created. Make sure you export it.
  Remember a post will need:

  - a `method` key
  - a `headers` key with the `'Content-Type'` of `'application/json'`
  - a `body` key that uses `JSON.stringify` to send the information

- Add a regular _action creator_ which should receive the information from the
  thunk action creator and use it as the payload.

- Create a constant to use in the action creator.

- Add a case in the reducer for adding a tweet and add a tweet using
  normalization. Do not mutate state!

### Component

- Add a __CreateTweet.js__ file inside the __frontend/src__ directory.
- In __CreateTweet.js__, code a `CreateTweet` component that returns a simple
  form for creating a tweet.
- Use local state for the tweet information.
- Use a `handleSubmit` function to check if the tweet is empty. If it isn't,
  dispatch the tweet using the thunk action creator.
- Don't forget to instantiate your component on the page!
