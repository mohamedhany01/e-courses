# Practice: Basic Hooks - useEffect

In this practice you will:

- Create a `useEffect` to change the color of the background based on an
  interval
  - Then add functionality to change the interval delay based on user input
- Create a `useEffect` to save the current [http status code][status-codes] in
  the browser's [`localStorage`][local-storage]

## Setup

Click the `Download Project` button at the bottom of this page to go to the
starter repo, then load the repo into [CodeSandbox].

## Part 1: Change background color

Your task in this part of the practice is to change the background color of your
app's `Cat Status` page every 5 seconds. The app currently sets the background
using the `colors` array imported from __data/data.js__ along with a number stored in
the `colorNum` slice of state (see __Cat.js__). You simply need to use
`setInterval` to update `colorNum` every 5 seconds.

[`setInterval`][set-interval] is a good example of a [_side
effect_][side-effects]. React prefers that you place side effects inside a
[`useEffect`][use-effect] hook.

Accordingly, to change the background color, you should create a `useEffect`
that takes a `setInterval` function inside the callback function. This
`useEffect` should run only once. (Hint: Check your homework if you don't
remember how to do this.)

The interval should change the `colorNum` slice of state every 5 seconds. When
setting the state, you should ensure that you have the most updated state. Also,
make sure that the state loops through the colors, i.e., it should return to the
first color after displaying the last color in the array.

Finally, the `Home` button at the top of the screen will, when clicked, return
the user to the home screen, effectively unmounting the `Cat` component. To
prevent a memory leak, make sure to cancel the interval in the `useEffect`
whenever the `Cat` component unmounts.

Your code should look similar to the code below:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const colorInterval = setInterval(() => {
    setColorIdx((prevIdx) => {
      const newIdx = ++prevIdx % colors.length;
      return newIdx;
    });

    return () => clearInterval(colorInterval);
  }, 5000);
}, []);
```

Remember, you must always use the clean up function when utilizing intervals
in a `useEffect`. Otherwise your application can develop memory leaks!

If you are doing this project on CodeSandbox, then the first two specs in the
__01-Cat-backgroundColor.test.js__ when clicking on the __Tests__ tab
should now pass.

If you are doing this project locally and you run `npm test 01`, the first
two specs in the __01-Cat-backgroundColor.test.js__ file should now pass.

## Change interval delay

With the current implementation the background color changes every 5 seconds.
Next you are going modify the `useEffect` you just created to have the interval
delay change based on the value of user submitted slice of state `delay`. This
slice of state is modified by the provided form and submit handler.

Take a moment to read the already provided `handleDelaySubmit` form submit
function. The function checks the value of `delay` before it sets the value
of the `delayChange` slice of state to `delay * 1000` (recall the
`setInterval` delay is looking for milliseconds). It is this slice of state
that the `setInterval` you created should take as an arg to programmatically
change the delay.

Modify the code that the `setInterval` delay should change any time the value
of `delayChange` changes. Recall you will need that slice of state added to the
dependency array to listen for updates.

Your code should now look similar to the code below:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const colorInterval = setInterval(() => {
    setColorIdx((prevIdx) => {
      const newIdx = ++prevIdx % colors.length;
      return newIdx;
    });
  }, delayChange);

  return () => clearInterval(colorInterval);
}, [delayChange]);
```

If you are doing this project on CodeSandbox, then all of the specs in the
__01-Cat-backgroundColor.test.js__ when clicking on the __Tests__ tab
should now pass.

If you are doing this project locally and you run `npm test 01`, all of the
specs in the __01-Cat-backgroundColor.test.js__ file should now pass.

## Part 2: Local Storage

[`localStorage`][local-storage] is another example of a side effect. It is a
part of the [Window object][window-object] in the browser. It can be used to
store trivial information that anyone is allowed to see. __You should never
store personal or private information in `localStorage`.__

Your next goal is to persist the value of `statusChange` in your `localStorage`.
If there is a value for `statusCode` stored in `localStorage`, the component's
`statusChange` state should be initialized to that value stored in
`localStorage`. If there is no `statusCode` value stored in `localStorage`, then
you should set the initial value of the `statusChange` to `418`.

Reminder, to access the value of a key-value pair in `localStorage`, you can use
the following syntax:

```js
localStorage.getItem(KEY); // => value
```

The key to store the cat status in your `localStorage` can be any value.

Open up your browser--not sandbox--DevTools. Choose `Application` from the top
bar. Look for `Local Storage` in the `Storage` section. You should see the
address of your sandbox browser (__NOT__ `https://codesandbox.io`). Right click
the address and choose `Clear`; this will clear out your app's `localStorage`.
When you reload the page, you should see a picture of a cat with the status code
`418 I'm a teapot`.

If you are doing this project on CodeSandbox, then the first two specs in the
__02-Cat-localStorage.test.js__ when clicking on the __Tests__ tab
should now pass.

If you are doing this project locally and you run `npm test 02`, the first
two specs in the __02-Cat-localStorage.test.js__ file should now pass.

Next, anytime the user sets a new `statusCode`, you should store that new
`statusCode` in your `localStorage` to persist that `statusCode` change. Even
if the user refreshes the browser, the `Cat` component should be initialized
to the `statusCode` most recently set by the user.

`useEffect` is the perfect place to do this. Create a `useEffect` that sets the
`statusCode` in `localStorage` whenever the `statusCode` gets updated.

Reminder, to set the value of a key-value pair in `localStorage`, you can use
the following syntax:

```js
localStorage.setItem(KEY, newValue);
```

With your DevTools still open and your `localStorage` clear, reload the sandbox
browser page and notice that your `localStorage` is immediately set with a
`statusCode` of `418`.

Type an existing status in the input box. Notice that `localStorage` updates
each time you click the `Change Status` button. Also notice that, if the
`statusCode` does not exist, it shows a `404` for the image. That is how [HTTP
Cats][http-cats] is built.

If you are doing this project on CodeSandbox, then all of the specs in the
__02-Cat-localStorage.test.js__ when clicking on the __Tests__ tab
should now pass.

If you are doing this project locally and you run `npm test 02`, all of the
specs in the __02-Cat-localStorage.test.js__ file should now pass.

## __BONUS__ Reset status code after no activity

As additional practice, implement a `useEffect` that resets the `statusCode`
back to the default "418" after 10 minutes of inactivity (if the user has not
submitted a new status code for 10 minutes). This should mean that the timer
resets on any changes to the status code.

For self testing you may use smaller durations to ensure you code is working
correctly.

You may have encountered such functionality on real websites, such as logging
out a user after a duration of inactivity. You could implement that with a
`useEffect` similar to the one you created to solve this problem!

If you are doing this project on CodeSandbox, then all of the specs in the
__03-BONUS-Cat-reset-statusCode.test.js__ when clicking on the __Tests__ tab
should now pass.

If you are doing this project locally and you run `npm test 03`, all of the
specs in the __03-BONUS-Cat-reset-statusCode.test.js__ file should now pass.

## What you have learned

__Congratulations!__ In this practice you have learned how to use `useEffect` to
handle:

1. Applying a `setInterval` function to change the background color
2. Storing and retrieving trivial data in `localStorage`
3. Listening to value changes in state to run side effects
