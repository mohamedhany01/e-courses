# Tic-Tac-Toe TDD (Challenge)

In this project, you will be implementing a computer tic-tac-toe AI using  **Test Driven Development**  (TDD).

Clone the project from the  [starter](https://github.com/appacademy-starters/ttt-tdd-project).

## Running the project

1.  Type  `npm install`  to install Chai and Mocha
2.  Type  `node game.js`  to run the game

This project builds off the first Tic-Tac-Toe project.

## Tasks

1.  Migrate your working  `ttt.js`  and  `cursor.js`  to this project.
2.  Fill out the static class in  `computer-player.js`  until tests are green.
3.  Update  `ttt.js`  to allow you to play against the computer AI.
4.  **BONUS**: Uncomment the bottom test in  `test/ttt-ai-spec.js`  and refine your AI until it can play 1000 games without losing.
