/*

Fix the function `adequateWaterTracker`. `adequateWaterTracker` should return
true if ALL the the weeks in the calendar array having more days in the week
that you drank water than you didn't.

For example, in this week, [0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 4, 0], each day represents how many
cups of water you drank that day. In this example, there were only 3 days where
you drank at least one cup of water.

A calendar is represented by multiple weeks,
[[0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 4, 0], [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1]].

If you drank water for at least 4 days of water for every week in the calendar,
then return true. Otherwise, return false.
