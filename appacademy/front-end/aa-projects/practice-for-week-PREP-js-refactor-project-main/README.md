# JavaScript Refactor Project

In this project, you will reexamine some problems you've tackled before but
with small tweaks. For the most part, the problems will be similar but with
modified criteria for what they should do.

The original code will be provided for you. Your job will be to read the new
descriptions of what the functions should do and modify the code to reflect
the new descriptions. Modify the given functions and make sure the names of the
functions match either the name indicated in the `New` instructions and/or the
`module.exports` so that your tests run properly.

This exercise is meant to simulate a real-world software engineering duty where
you may be introduced to an old codebase and be asked to make updates. You
will be practicing the important skills of reading and understanding code!

Tests have been written for you already to test if your answers behave as
intended. To run the tests, simply run:

```shell
npm install
```

Followed by:

```shell
npm run test
```

If your tests aren't running, make sure Mocha is installed globally.
