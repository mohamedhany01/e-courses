/***********************************************************************
Write a function called `subsets` that will return all subsets of an array.

Examples: 

subsets([]) // [[]]
subsets([1]) // [[], [1]]
subsets([1, 2]) // [[], [1], [2], [1, 2]]
subsets([1, 2, 3]) // [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]

Hint: For subsets([1, 2, 3]), there are two kinds of subsets:
  1. Those that do not contain 3 (all of these are subsets of [1, 2]).
  2. For every subset that does not contain 3, there is also a corresponding
     subset that is the same, except it also does contain 3.
