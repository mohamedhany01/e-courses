# Basic JavaScript Practice v2

In this practice, you will be taking some of the exercises you performed in Part
1 using the browser's console, and rewriting them into JavaScript files.

The problems will be reiterated again, and your job is to write the solution
for each problem within the provided function declarations.

Download the starter [here][starter].

DO NOT copy and paste your old answers.  Use this opportunity to apply
what you have learned to practice re-solving problems.  If you get stuck,
avoid the temptation to look at your old code.  Referencing things you
wrote before is a great trick as a developer, but you'll do better here and
at the start of the program if you use this as an opportunity to practice.

Tests have been written for you already to test if your answers behave as
intended. To run the tests, simply run:

```shell
npm install
```

Followed by:

```shell
npm run test
```

If your tests aren't running, make sure Mocha is installed globally.
